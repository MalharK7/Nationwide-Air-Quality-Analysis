# Nationwide-Air-Quality-Analysis

This study has two goals: first, it will examine the temporal and spatial patterns of air pollution in India, with a particular focus on 17 cities from 5 states; second, it will evaluate the effects of air pollution on environmental policy and public health.


The dataset is initially stored in MongoDB, a NoSQL database, where it is organized and made accessible for further processing. Using PySpark, a powerful data processing framework, the data is extracted from MongoDB and preprocessed to clean, filter, and aggregate it, preparing it for analysis. PySpark's distributed computing capabilities handle the large-scale dataset efficiently. Once the data is processed, it is visualized using PowerBI, a business analytics tool, to create interactive and insightful visualizations. These visualizations help in gaining meaningful insights into the air quality trends and patterns, facilitating informed decision-making and policy formulation
